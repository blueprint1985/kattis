My Kattis Stuff

This is my solved Kattis problems from https://open.kattis.com/problems. Inside each solution is a link to the specific problem.

These problems are just solved for fun, which means that there may be both better and faster solutions out there.

Many, if not all, problems have restrictions on the input data. I will not make any checks that the input data follows these restrictions since as far as I have been able to find out, no input data in the Kattis Judge is outside these restrictions.

Any questions, please mail martinbjorling@gmail.com
